Rebecca is currently a postdoctoral research associate at the <a href="https://www.pasteur.fr/en">Institut Pasteur</a> in the <a href="https://research.pasteur.fr/en/team/genetics-of-biofilms/">Genetics of Biofilms Unit</a> within the Microbiology Department. Her <a href="#projects">current research</a> focuses on microbial ecology within a gnotobiotic zebrafish model to determine mechanisms of colonization resistance. We are examining these interactions using quantitative meta-'omics, molecular biology, and  <i>in vivo</i> manipulation assays. 

Her doctoral research at the University of Rhode Island <a href="https://web.uri.edu/gso/">Graduate School of Oceanography</a> focused on oyster-associated microbiomes and how they are affected by estuarine acidification, nutrient loading, disease, or probiotics. We used traditional microbiology techniques, bioinformatics, and statistical modelling applied to aquaculture or field experiments to determine how bacteria in oysters contribute to their resilience and ability to provide ecosystem services.
