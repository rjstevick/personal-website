Rebecca is a postdoctoral research associate at the <a href="https://www.pasteur.fr/en">Institut Pasteur</a> in the <a href="https://research.pasteur.fr/en/team/genetics-of-biofilms/">Biofilm Genetics Unit</a> within the Microbiology Department. 

Her <a href="#projects">current research</a> is focused on microbial ecology within a gnotobiotic zebrafish model to determine mechanisms of colonization resistance. She studies this with molecular biology, bioinformatics, and <i>in vivo</i> manipulation assays. During her PhD, she studied oyster-associated microbiomes and how they are affected by estuarine acidification, nutrient loading, disease, or probiotics.
