Rebecca is a PhD candidate and NSF Predoctoral Fellow at the University of Rhode Island <a href="https://web.uri.edu/gso/">Graduate School of Oceanography</a>, with a focus on biological oceanography and microbial ecology. 

Her <a href="#projects">current research</a> focuses on oyster-associated microbiomes and how they are affected by estuarine acidification, nutrient loading, disease, or probiotics. She studies this with molecular biology, bioinformatics, and statistical modelling applied to aquaculture or field experiments. She is interested in how bacteria in oysters contribute to their resilience and ability to provide ecosystem services.
