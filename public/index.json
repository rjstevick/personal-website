A significant ecosystem service is their ability to improve water quality by filtration and denitrification. These ecological functions are made possible by oyster-associated microbes, but may also be threatened by microbial pathogens. This positions the oyster as a model system for the study of marine host-associated microbial diversity and function. However, studies of microbial diversity and function in shellfish are lacking, particularly in response to environmental perturbations. As coastal ecosystems change due to anthropogenic impacts and climate variability, it is important to understand how the oyster microbiome is affected and how this may impact the host. This dissertation emphasizes the significance of oyster-associated microbiomes and their importance to aquaculture disease prevention, wild fishery sustainability, and coastal restoration efficacy. As urbanization, coastal acidification, and disease outbreaks increase, it is important to understand these oyster-associated microbial community dynamics and how they might vary with environmental change.","tags":null,"title":"Oyster-Associated Microbial Community Dynamics","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rebecca J.

We propose that the presence of probiotics causes shifts in bacterial community structure in rearing tanks, leading to a net decrease in the relative abundance of potential pathogens. During three trials spanning the 2012–2015 hatchery seasons, larvae, tank biofilm, and rearing water samples were collected from control and probiotic-treated tanks in an oyster hatchery over a 12-day period after spawning. Samples were analyzed by 16S rRNA sequencing of the V4 or V6 regions followed by taxonomic classification, in order to determine bacterial community structures. There were significant differences in bacterial composition over time and between sample types, but no major effect of probiotics on the structure and diversity of bacterial communities (phylum level, Bray–Curtis k = 2, 95% confidence). Probiotic treatment, however, led to a higher relative percent abundance of Oceanospirillales and Bacillus spp. in water and oyster larvae. In the water, an increase in Vibrio spp. diversity in the absence of a net increase in relative read abundance suggests a likely decrease in the abundance of specific pathogenic Vibrio spp., and therefore lower chances of a disease outbreak. Co-occurrence network analysis also suggests that probiotic treatment had a systemic effect on targeted members of the bacterial community, leading to a net decrease in potentially pathogenic species.","tags":null,"title":"Bacterial Community Dynamics in an Oyster Hatchery in Response to Probiotic Treatment","type":"publication"},{"authors":["José A.

The rapid growth of the aquaculture industry and improvement in the preservation and transport of seafood have enabled them to be readily available anywhere in the world. Over the years, oysters, mussels, scallops, and clams have been the focus of research for improving the production, managing resources, and investigating basic biological and ecological questions. During this decade, an impressive amount of information using high-throughput genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic technologies has been produced in various classes of the Mollusca group, and it is anticipated that basic and applied research will significantly benefit from this resource. One aspect that is also taking momentum is the use of bivalves as a model system for human health. In this review, we highlight some of the aspects of the biology of bivalves that have direct implications in human health including the shell formation, stem cells and cell differentiation, the ability to fight opportunistic and specific pathogens in the absence of adaptive immunity, as source of alternative drugs, mucosal immunity and, microbiome turnover, toxicology, and cancer research. There is still a long way to go; however, the next time you order a dozen oysters at your favorite raw bar, think about a tasty model organism that will not only please your palate but also help unlock multiple aspects of molluscan biology and improve human health.","tags":null,"title":"From the raw bar to the bench: Bivalves as models for human health","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Check out our web app that describes the environmental conditions and oyster characteristics in Narragansett Bay: https://rjstevick.shinyapps.io/nbay_shinyapp/.\nGithub repositories: https://github.com/rjstevick/NBayTNCoystersAnalysis https://github.com/rjstevick/AllNBayWildOystersCombined\n","date":1535760000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1535760000,"objectID":"6f98e582a43f03d36d997d77d3957d17","permalink":"/project/estuarineacidification/","publishdate":"2018-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/estuarineacidification/","section":"project","summary":"Understanding how oyster microbiomes and health change along a eutropication gradient.","tags":null,"title":"Estuarine acidification and oyster health","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"This image and the pieces were printed on a 3\u0026rsquo;x4\u0026rsquo; vinyl poster and is used at various outreach events.\nAccess the materials here: Oyster Anatomy puzzle\n","date":1535760000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1535760000,"objectID":"3f2613015f806824cdab86627253ef0f","permalink":"/outreachmaterials/oysteranatomy/","publishdate":"2018-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/outreachmaterials/oysteranatomy/","section":"outreachmaterials","summary":"Outreach tool created to show the organs of an oyster and how they fit together.","tags":null,"title":"Oyster Anatomy Puzzle","type":"outreachmaterials"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":".\n","date":1504224000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1504224000,"objectID":"987a2406a34f5a712f67d4658860e632","permalink":"/project/denitrification/","publishdate":"2017-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/denitrification/","section":"project","summary":"Determining the responses of oyster microbiomes when exposed to high nutrient conditions.","tags":null,"title":"Nutrient enrichment and oyster microbiomes","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Check out our web app that describes the environmental conditions and oyster characteristics in Narragansett Bay: https://rjstevick.shinyapps.io/nbay_shinyapp/.\nThe source code can be found here: https://github.com/rjstevick/NarragansettBayShinyApp/\n","date":1504224000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1504224000,"objectID":"23aaf37334b0ab833d568c7884e70c38","permalink":"/outreachmaterials/shinyapp_nbayoysters/","publishdate":"2017-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/outreachmaterials/shinyapp_nbayoysters/","section":"outreachmaterials","summary":"Web app of oyster health and environmental parameters for outreach.","tags":null,"title":"R ShinyApp of Oysters in Narragansett Bay","type":"outreachmaterials"},{"authors":["Olivia M.

The most common data storage techniques employed in these algorithms are flat files or relational databases. While sophisticated indexing techniques can accelerate queries, an alternative is to store biological sequence data directly in a way that supports efficient queries. Here we introduce a new algorithm that aims to compress the redundant information and improve the performance of query speed with the help of graphical databases, which have been commercially available since the mid-late 2000s. A graphical database stores information using nodes and relationships (edges). Our approach is to identify sub-sequences that are common among many sequences, and to store these as common nodes in the graph database. This is accomplished for sequencing data as follows; split the whole sequence into k-mers; if a given k-mer is common to enough sequences, then it is labeled as a common segment; if a k-mer is unique (or common to too few sequences), then it is labeled as a single segment. Thus, common nodes and single nodes are formed from common segments and single segments, respectively. These two kinds of nodes are connected by edges in the graphical database; this allows each original sequences to be reconstructed by following edges in the graph. This graphical database model allows for fast taxonomic queries of 16S rDNA. When queried, the database can first attempt to find common nodes that match the query sequence, and subsequently follow edges to single nodes to refine the search. This approach is analogous to that of compressive genomics, except that the compression is implicit in the graphical database storage model. Beyond simple sequence queries, this graphical database representation also supports variability analysis, which identifies highly variable vs. conserved regions of 16S sequence. Regions of low variability correspond to common nodes, while regions of high variability correspond to a variety of paths through single nodes. Benchmarking of sequence search indicates that query time in graphical databases is significantly faster than in flat files or relational databases. Implementation of graphical databases in genomic data analysis will allow for accelerated search, and may lend itself to other forms of efficient analysis, such as tetramer frequency analysis, which is useful in metagenomic binning.","tags":null,"title":"Analysis of 16S Genomic Data using Graphical Databases","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":".\n","date":1472688000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1472688000,"objectID":"3d5cc5f9a07997d7c8fb17d5b43f9e5d","permalink":"/project/transcriptmining/","publishdate":"2016-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/transcriptmining/","section":"project","summary":"Leveraging publically available transcriptomes to determine overall responses.","tags":null,"title":"Oyster-associated microbial transcriptomes","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"We have partnered with oyster hatcheries across the east coast of the United States to evaulate how probiotic addition affects the hatchery microbiome and oyster health.\nGitHub repository:\nhttps://github.com/rjstevick/RWUOysterHatcheryProbiotics16S\nRelated publications:\nStevick, R.J., Sohn, S., Nelson, D.R., Rowley, D.C., Tammi, K., Smolowitz, R., Lundgren, K.M., Post, A.F. and Gomez-Chiarri, M.
